# Bella

## What is it?

A next generation **compile-time** persistence layer for Java applications, utilizing [JavaPoet](https://github.com/palantir/javapoet) for code generation.

## Why is it?

Solutions like JPA Hibernate and other ORM's are either:
- Lacking in features
- Affect runtime performance drastically
- Are far too complex

Bella was created to be a simple, fully-featured alternative to existing options.

## What's the status?

At this moment, Bella is nowhere near complete and is **not** ready for production use. Many features must still be implemented.

## Todo

- Complete SQLite implementation
- Complete PostgreSQL implementation
- Complete MariaDB implementation
- Complete MySQL implementation
- Complete file implementations
  - JSON
  - YML
